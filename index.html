<p>Who's investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between the business of education and education politics and policies? What do we know about the relationships among companies, entrepreneurs, investors, institutions, and politicians?</p>

<p>I started tracking ed-tech funding in detail in 2015, in part because I wanted to be able to see the relationships between funders and founders and the stories told about the future of education. I have a fairly decent idea of where the money has gone from 2010 thru 2018.</p>

<p>You can read project updates via this <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/archives.html">site's blog</a>. There are also articles there that provide funding data for the various "<a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>" I have monitored.</p>
