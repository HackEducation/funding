<p>Who's investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between politics and policies? Between dollars and trends? Who's funding teacher-founded startups? Who's funding women and minority-led startups? What does the "map" of the ed-tech industry look like? What are the relationships between companies, entrepreneurs, investors, and institutions?</p>

<p>I started tracking ed-tech funding in detail in 2015. (You can view that site at <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">matrix.hackeducation.com</a>.) I'm starting afresh this year, with a better data model, better visualizations, and more frequent updates. Hopefully.</p>

<p>You can read updates via this <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/blog/">site's blog</a>. You can also contribute directly via <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding">the GitHub repo that powers this site</a>.</p>
