This folder contains JSON files detailing investors' names, investments, acquisitions, mergers, and more. The filenames include the year (and for the current year, the month). 

You can download the repository or you can copy the contents of the files you want. To convert the JSON into CSV, I recommend this tool: http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/.

If you have questions or find problems with this data, please leave an issue on this repository.
