<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; for July 2017:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />

<p>The amount of money invested so far this year remains higher than at the same time in 2016 and 2015. But the number of investment deals has fallen. That is to say, the funding total for the year is being driven by a small number of very large investments &#8211; there have been seven of $100 million or more.</p>
