<p>Just a quick note to say that I have updated <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">my list of all education-related grants by the Gates Foundation</a>. (There were a few made in December that I didn&#8217;t catch when I finalized my year-end numbers.)</p>

<p>There were over 200 education grants funded in 2017, totaling more than $238.5 million.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this project for this year is to make this information searchable not just by year but by the topics that Gates has funded and promoted: &#8220;personalized learning,&#8221; of course, but also the Common Core, teacher performance, and the like.</p>
