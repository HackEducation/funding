<p>Edsurge writes up "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-27-updates-upgrades-and-overheard-what-was-unveiled-at-iste-2017">â€‹Updates, Upgrades and Overheard: What Was Unveiled at ISTE 2017</a>." It's not <em>everything</em> that happened at the giant vendor event. So it's interesting to see whose press releases get a mention here:

<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Amazon (actually a note that there was no news at ISTE)</li>
<li>SchoolDude</li>
<li>Newsela (which shares investors with Edsurge: NewSchools Venture Fund, Reach Capital, Women's Venture Capital Fund)</li>
<li>Achieve3000</li>
<li>Kahoot!</li>
<li>Renaissance Learning</li>
<li>Educlipper (which shares an investor with Edsurge: Learn Capital)</li>
<li>Participate Learning</li>
<li>Certica Solutions</li>
<li>Unbound Concepts</li>
<li>ItemLogic</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</p>
