<p>"Would You Like Higher Ed With That? Guild Education's Playbook to Educating Employees," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-24-would-you-like-higher-ed-with-that-guild-education-s-playbook-to-educating-employees">Edsurge wrote on May 24, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Guild Education<a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: 1776. (Interestingly, when Edsurge lists Guild Education's investors in the article, it does not mention 1776 at all.)</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track on the publication's disclosure issues.</p>
