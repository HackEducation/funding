<p>Edsurge touts "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-27-the-power-of-nonprofit-acquisitions-curriculet-rises-from-the-dead">The Power of Nonprofit Acquisitions: Curriculet Rises from the Dead</a>," noting that Curriculet's acquisition by Waterford means the curriculum company is back in operation. There is no disclosure in the article that Edsurge <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">shares an investor</a> with Curriculet: NewSchools Venture Fund.</p> 

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</p>
