<p>Here are the funding totals for March 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount invested: $220,300,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 17</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $13,768,750 / Median investment size: $10,000,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 5</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The total amount of investment for March 2017 is higher than either March 2016 or 2015, in part because of the number of investments this month that were more than $20,000,000: Nearpod, Examity, MakeBlock, BYJU's, and MasterClass.</p>

<p>(The funding total for 2017 so far is also higher than the two previous years at this stage. It's higher, of course, because of the <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/03/01/february">$500 million invested in SoFi last month</a>. If you exclude that one investment (I don't think you should, but if you do), then the total funding figure for the year-to-date down is down from 2016 and from 2015.)</p>

<p>Also of note:</p>

<p>There were three investments this month in "financial aid management startups": Regent Education, CampusLogic, and Raise.me. I've insisted for some time now that the private student loan industry was one to watch (i.e. SoFi), but let's expand that category now to a more generalized effort to privatize financial aid as a product and as a service.</p>

<p>In other news:</p>

<p>The Chinese test prep company BYJU's raised $30 million this month. It's now raised $204 million total, making it one of the most heavily invested ed-tech startups. (Its investors include Aarin Capital, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, IFC Venture Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Sofina, Times Internet, and Verlinvest.)</p>
