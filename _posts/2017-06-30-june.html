<p>Here are the venture funding totals for education companies for the month of June 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount invested: $295,942,070</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $16,441,226 / Median investment size: $3,820,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 6</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m going to write a more in-depth analysis of the funding for the year-to-date tomorrow. Many publications have been touting the fact that after a dip last year, ed-tech investments appear to be &#8220;<a href="http://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-second-wind-vc-investment-in-edtech-is-rising-again-datagraphic">rising again</a>.&#8221; But I think the picture is much more complicated than that. And whether the dollar figures or the deal numbers are up or down, it&#8217;s important to look at where the money is going &#8211; what kinds of companies are raising money? </p>

<p>Stay tuned&#8230; Or, as always, you can simply run the numbers yourself. I do make this data freely available <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">via the GitHub repository that powers this site</a>.</p>
