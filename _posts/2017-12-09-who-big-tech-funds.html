<p><em>This article offers more information about <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/platforms.html">part four</a> of my annual review of the year-in-ed-tech. Here are some of the details about who&#8217;s investing in learning management systems.</em></p>

<p>None of the major technology platforms acquired any education companies this year.</p>

<p>Their investments this year include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The computer refurbishing company Neverware, which raised <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16455490/google-invest-neverware-chromebooks-refurbish">$6.5 million</a> from Google Ventures</li>
<li>The coding bootcamp Andela, which raised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/andela-start-up-coding-africa.html">$40 million</a> from Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (along with Spark Capital, CRE Venture Capital, TLcom Capital Partners, VentureSouq, DBL Partners, and Amplo)</li>
<li>The tutoring company Cuemath, which raised <a href="http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-sme-start-ups/cuemath-cuemath-raises-15-million-from-capitalg-and-sequoia-india-117012300123_1.html">$15 million</a> from CapitalG (formerly Google Capital, along with Sequoia India)</li>
<li>Game-based learning company Kahoot, which raised $10 million from Microsoft Ventures (along with Creandum and Northzone)</li>
<li>Job placement company Viridis Learning, which raised an undisclosed amount of money from Salesforce Ventures (along with Thayer Ventures)</li>
</ul>

<p>(I have not included all of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s investments via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in this list. You can see details about his investment portfolio &#8211; or what we know, at least &#8211; <a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/chan-zuckerberg-initiative/investments.html">here</a>. Nor have I included the Gates Foundation&#8217;s investments. I will address both of these in a subsequent article in this series.)</p>

<p>The tech giants did fund many other initiatives through grants and gifts. And I haven&#8217;t kept good track of that. Google, for example, <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/google-europe/funding-udacity-scholarships-digital-skills/">funded scholarships at Udacity</a>. It&#8217;s also spending money to <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/google-org/investing-1-million-training-computing-teachers-uk-1/">train computer science teachers in the UK</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/technology/now-on-oracles-campus-a-43-million-public-high-school.html">Oracle opened a public high school on its campus</a>. I&#8217;ll do better keeping track of this next year&#8230;</p>
