<p>I&#8217;m starting a new report on ed-tech startup funding &#8211; it&#8217;s related to this one &#8211; that tracks <em>all</em> investors and <em>all</em> their education-related investments since 2009 (the year I started Hack Education). </p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t quite decided yet how I&#8217;ll present the data &#8211; I think sorted by investor, but the point will be that I can provide an ongoing update to stories like &#8220;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/05/whos-investing-in-ed-tech">Who&#8217;s Investing in Ed-Tech?</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>This data will also be made available &#8211; freely and openly &#8211; in a JSON file so that others can access and utilize it.</p>

<p>More details coming soon...</p>
