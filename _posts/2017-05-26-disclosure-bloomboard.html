<p>"Texas Partners With BloomBoard to Bring Competency-Based PD to the State," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-24-texas-partners-with-bloomboard-to-bring-competency-based-pd-to-the-state">Edsurge wrote on May 24, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Bloomboard <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Imagine K12, Learn Capital, and the Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track on the publication's disclosure issues.</p>
