<p>It's really just a rewrite of a press release, but Edsurge notes that "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-13-cory-reid-former-ceo-of-instructure-and-masteryconnect-lands-new-gig-at-tyton-partners">Cory Reid, Former CEO of Instructure and MasteryConnect, Lands New Gig at Tyton Partners</a>." There is no disclosure on the article that Edsurge shares investors with <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">MasteryConnect</a>: NewSchools Venture Fund, Learn Capital, GSV, and Catamount Ventures.</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems.</p>
