<p>Here are the venture funding totals for April 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount invested: $244,658,680</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 9</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $30,582,335 / Median investment size: $4,000,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 6</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of investment this month was higher than either April 2016 or 2015, because of the massive $190,000,000 investment in online education company EverFi. (This accounted for more than three-quarters of the total venture capital raised in April.)</p>

<p>The funding total for 2017 remains higher than the two previous years at this stage. It's higher, of course, because of the <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/03/01/february">$500 million invested in SoFi in February</a>. If you exclude that one investment (I don't think you should, but if you do), then the total funding figure for the year-to-date is up from 2016 (by about $50 million) but down from 2015 (by about $140 million).</p>

<p>The companies that have raised the most money so far this year are:</p>

<ul>
<li>SoFi ($500,000,000 for student loans)</li>
<li>EverFi ($190,000,000 for online skills training)</li>
<li>Xueba100.com ($100,000,000 for "homework help")</li>
<li>MasterClass ($35,000,000 for online classes taught by celebrities)</li>
<li>College Ave ($30,000,000 for student loans)</li>
<li>BYJU's ($30,000,000 for test prep)</li>
<li>MakeBlock ($30,000,000 for robotics)</li>
<li>Top Hat ($22,500,000 for classroom response systems)</li>
<li>Examity ($21,000,000 for testing)</li>
<li>Nearpod ($21,000,000 for classroom presentation software)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those top three account for more than 65% of the money raised so far this year. (And again, if you exclude SoFi, the investments in EverFi and Xueba100.com constitute about 40% of the money raised so far this year.)</p>
