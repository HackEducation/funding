<p>"MOOCs Started Out Completely Free. Where Are They Now?," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-20-moocs-started-out-completely-free-where-are-they-now">Edsurge wrote on April 20, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Panorama <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge">share an investor</a>: Imagine K-12.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products that it says schools should buy.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this and other disclosure alerts, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/01/02/disclosure">read this blog post.</a></em></p>
