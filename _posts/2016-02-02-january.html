<p>I&#8217;ve crunched the numbers on the year-so-far for ed-tech funding, and 2016 certainly seems to be off to a less auspicious start than 2015. Last year, there were 23 funding rounds in January, totaling over $358 million. By my calculations, there were just 17 this past month, with a total that was less than half 2015&#8217;s: $166 million. There were 8 acquisitions. (Of course, January 2015 featured Lynda.com's massive $186 million investment.)</p>

<p>Last year was the first year I kept a record (to the best of my ability) on ed-tech funding. You can find that project at <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">matrix.hackeducation.com</a>. This year, I want to track more details &#8211; whether startups are selling products at the K&#8211;12 or university or corporate level, for example.</p>

<p>But just like last year, I am making this data freely available. You can find the JSON files in the GitHub repo that powers this website: <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding">github.com/audreywatters/funding</a>.</p>

<p>Some observations from this month&#8217;s investments:</p>

<ul>
<li>About $57 million went to K&#8211;12-focused startups; about $63 million went to those focused at the post-secondary level; and about $45 million went to those focused on corporate education.</li>
<li>Almost half the total amount of money raised this month went to two companies: Jerry Education and Grovo (they each raised $40 million). Not surprising because of these two big rounds, the two areas that raised the most money: tutoring and corporate training.</li>
<li>Of the 17 startups raising money, 2 were from India, 2 were from China, and 10 were from the US.</li>
<li>The two companies that raised the most money in 2015 were student loan providers (that is, SoFi and Earnest). The student loan startup sector saw a $20 million raise this year. It&#8217;s too early for predictions, but it won&#8217;t surprise me if this pattern (trend) continues.</li>
</ul>
