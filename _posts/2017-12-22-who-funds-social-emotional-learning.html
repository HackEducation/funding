<p><em>These are the investments and acquisitions related to <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/social-emotional-learning.html">part ten</a> of my year-in-review series.</em></p>

<h3>Investments in Behavior Management Companies</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Hero K12 raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-19-with-150-million-to-spend-hero-k12-goes-shopping-for-education-technology-companies">$150 million</a> in June from private equity firm BV Investment Partners</li>
<li>Flipd raised an <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-08-25-investors-back-an-app-that-reminds-students-to-get-off-their-phones-in-class">undisclosed</a> amount of funding in August from Ryerson Futures Inc and Candice Faktor</li>
</ul>

<h3>Acquisitions in Behavior Management</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Hero K&#8211;12 <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-10-30-hero-k12-mints-its-first-acquisition-school-enrollment-startup-schoolmint">acquired</a> SchoolMint in October</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investments in &#8220;Social Emotional Learning&#8221; Companies</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Panorama Education <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-11-07-panorama-education-raises-16m-to-connect-emotional-academic-wellbeing-with-data">raised</a> $16 million in November from Emerson Collective, Spark Capital, Owl Ventures, SoftTechVC, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</li>
<li>Peekapak raised $940,000 in September from Imagine K12, Umang Gupta, Voqal Education, and JOLT. It also received a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peekapak">grant</a> (an undisclosed amount) from NewSchools Venture Fund</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s really striking to me that a &#8220;trend&#8221; that Edsurge and Education Week would cover so extensively this year would have such little investor activity. Of course, ClassDojo isn&#8217;t on this list above. It&#8217;s raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classdojo">$31 million</a> total (last raising money last year). But there are just 6 companies listed in Edsurge&#8217;s product database that sell social-emotional stuff.</p>
