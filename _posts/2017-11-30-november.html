<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for November 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $704 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $39.1 million / Median investment size: $7 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />

<p>I debated whether or not two very large investments this month should be included in my calculations: $500 million invested in WorldStrides, an accredited student travel company, and $400 million invested in UBTech, a robotics company. The latter says its robots have entertainment and educational functions, but I just couldn&#8217;t see enough of the latter in their marketing material to justify their inclusion. The former I have included, even though people will complain &#8220;that&#8217;s not ed-tech.&#8221; <em>When venture capitalists and private equity are interested in a concept, we&#8217;re better off paying attention than pretending like a strict definition of &#8220;learning technologies&#8221; matter.</em></p>

<p>That $500 million boosts the amount of money invested so far this year much much higher than the two previous years &#8211; the amount of time I&#8217;ve been keeping track of the details of funding. Even so, the number of investment deals has fallen &#8211; there are five fewer deals than this time last year and nineteen fewer than in 2015. The growth in funding continues to be driven this year by a small number of very large investments. (There were three investments this month of $40 million or more.) </p>

<p>Acquisitions continue to be down from previous years &#8211; off by ten from last year and twenty from 2015. There have been a number of IPOs this year &#8211; the other way that investors can get a return on their money &#8211; but these have been almost exclusively by Chinese education companies</p>
