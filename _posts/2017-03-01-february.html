<p>Education technology startups raised $566,950,000 in February. But there should probably be an asterisk next to that figure as $500 million of it went to the student loan startup SoFi (which says it plans to expand beyond student loans). I&#8217;ve also excluded from this particular calculation the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/researchgate-raised-52-million-goldman-bill-gates-2017-2">$52 million raised by research network ResearchGate</a> as that deal was actually closed in 2015 although it wasn&#8217;t disclosed until now.</p>

<p>If you <em>include</em> SoFi&#8217;s $500 million, the totals for this month were almost three times as much as those in February 2016 and double the totals for the same time in 2015. But if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> count SoFi &#8211; and many ed-tech publications prefer not to talk about student loan financing (I&#8217;ve written more about that <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/01/ed-tech-calculations">here</a>) &#8211; then the figures for this month were off by about half from the same time last year. </p>

<p>Here are the totals for February 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount invested: $566,950,000</strong> (if you exclude SoFi, the total is $66,950,000)</li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 15</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $40,496,429 / Median: $2,500,000</strong> (if you exclude SoFi, the average is $4,682,143)</li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 7</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Student loans companies &#8211; particularly with the massive Series F round for SoFi &#8211; obviously continue to be the most well-funded type of ed-tech startups. Learn-to-code companies also remain popular among venture capitalists.</p>
