<p>Education technology startups raised <strong>$172,150,000</strong> in January. More than half that total was the $100,000,000 invested in homework help platform Xueba100.com.</p>

<p>The total for January was down by about $2 million from this time last year, and down by about half from January 2015 (a record-setting year for ed-tech investment). The size of the average investment was down by about $1 million. The number of deals &#8211; 22 &#8211; was up slightly from January 2016 when there were 17. There were 11 acquisitions in January; the same as last year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s far too early to identify trends, although I can&#8217;t help but notice that a student loan startup, a tutoring startup, and two homework help startups raised money. Some things do not change&#8230;</p>

<p>As always the data for this project is freely <a href="https://github.com/hackeducation/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
