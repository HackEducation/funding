<p>2015 was <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">a record-setting year</a> for ed-tech investment. 2016, not so much. Indeed, the amount of money invested in ed-tech this year fell by 47%.</p>

<p><strong>Total dollar amount: $2,177,833,280</strong></p>

<p>The number of investments fell by 11%.</p>

<p><strong>Total deals: 201</strong></p>

<p>(For comparison: in 2015, there were 225 funding deals totaling $4,147,226,000.)</p>

<p>More than half of the investments this year were to startups founded <em>outside</em> the United States:</p>

<p>The companies that raised the most venture capital this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Age of Learning (educational apps) &#8211; $150,000,000</li>
<li>BYJU&#8217;s (test prep) &#8211; $140,000,000</li>
<li>Podotree (educational apps) &#8211; $107,000,000</li>
<li>VIPKID (English language learning) &#8211; $100,000,000</li>

<li>Kaltura (video platform) &#8211; $50,000,000</li>
<li>Galvanize (coding bootcamp) &#8211; $45,000,000</li>
<li>Matific (math games) &#8211; $45,000,000</li>

<li>Jerry Education (tutoring) &#8211; $40,000,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Those building educational apps, those offering online tutoring or test prep, those promising &#8220;skills&#8221; training, and those offering student loans were the most well funded and most frequently funded types of ed-tech companies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve listed <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/12/26/investors">the most active investors of the year in a separate article</a>. (These are mostly unchanged from 2015.) Venture capitalists sit at one end of the life cycle of ed-tech funding. At the other end: companies <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/12/02/dead-pool">close</a>; they merge; they IPO (very very very rarely &#8211; there was just one education IPO this year: China Online Education Group); they&#8217;re acquired.</p>

<p>The number of acquisitions was up this year by 16% &#8211; there were 90 in 2015 and 104 in 2016. The most active acquirer this year was PowerSchool, which itself was <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-06-18-pearson-to-sell-powerschool-to-vista-equity-partners-for-350m">acquired</a> by the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners last June. PowerSchool acquired six companies in 2016; Frontline Education acquired five. The biggest ed-tech acquisition this year was Microsoft&#8217;s purchase of LinkedIn for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/business/dealbook/microsoft-to-buy-linkedin-for-26-2-billion.html">$26.2 billion</a>. (Yes. I&#8217;m counting this as ed-tech. Come at me.) Popular acquisition targets: coding bootcamps.</p>

<p>As always, the data for this analysis is freely and openly available <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">via the GitHub repository</a> that powers the funding.hackeducation.com site.</p>
