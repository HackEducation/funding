<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for XXX:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>As you can see by the list below of the companies that have raised the most money, &#8220;tutoring&#8221; remains one of the most popular pits for venture capitalists to throw their money into. Tutoring often works to expand existing education inequalities, so that&#8217;s always fund to consider the ways in which ed-tech and venture capital continue to make the world worse.</p>

<p>Coding bootcamps were again a popular investment this month &#8211; part of a larger narrative that key education VCs are pushing about a more efficient, more skills-oriented higher ed marketplace. (Of course, coding bootcamps and other &#8220;alternatives&#8221; litter this year&#8217;s ed-tech deadpool too. Good times.)</p>
