<p>I have updated this project with November funding information. As always, the data is freely and openly available <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">via the GitHub repository</a> that powers this site.</p>

<p>The amount of money raised in November was the lowest of any month so far this year: just $85 million. I wrote almost the same sentence last month: &#8220;October was the lowest of any month so far this year: $111 million.&#8221; I&#8217;ll repeat this one from October too: &#8220;The number of deals and the number of acquisitions were also the lowest they&#8217;ve been all year.&#8221; That is to say, VC interest in education technology waned in October, and that trend has continues to spiral downward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount invested: $85,000,000</li>
<li>Number of investments: 11</li>
<li>Average investment size: $7,729,090 / Median: $4,000,000</li>
<li>Number of acquisitions: 5</li>
<li>Number of mergers: 0</li>
</ul>

<p>This list of those ed-tech startups who&#8217;ve raised the most money this year remains unchanged <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/10/31/october">from October&#8217;s update</a>.</p>

<p>The total invested so far in 2016 is off significantly from this time last year. More analysis to come as I examine "The Business of Ed-Tech" as <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">part of my annual year-in-review</a>.</p>
