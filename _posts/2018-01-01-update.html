<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes to this site, most obviously updating the header image. <a href="http://bryanmmathers.com/">Thanks to Bryan Mathers</a>. (<a href="http://pigeons.hackeducation.com/">Why a pigeon</a>?)</p>

<p>Those who look closely will also note that I have also changed the copyright information. No longer is there a Creative Commons license on Hack Education material. This really doesn&#8217;t change much, I promise. <em>It just means you have to ask my permission</em> before republishing my work. If you do wish to reprint my writing, <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">please contact me directly</a>.</p>
