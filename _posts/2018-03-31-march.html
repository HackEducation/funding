<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for March 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $402.5 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $25.16 million / Median investment size: $5.76 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of spinoffs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 0</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>Although the total amount of money raised in March is the largest of the year so far, that figure is a little deceiving. Of the $402.5 million raised in March, over 70% of that money went to three companies: $200 million in the &#8220;homework help&#8221; company 17zuoye, $50 million in the student loan provider CommonBond, and $42 million in the alt-credential company Degreed.</p>

<h3>The Biggest Investments of 2018 (So Far)</h3>
<br />
<p>The companies that have raised the most money so far this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>17zouye</strong> (tutoring): $200 million</li>
<li><strong>Zhangmen</strong> (tutoring): $120 million</li>
<li><strong>DadaABC</strong> (English language learning) : $100 million</li>
<li><strong>Varsity Tutors</strong> (tutoring): $50 million</li>
<li><strong>Common Bond</strong> (student loan): $50 million</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice a pattern?</p>
