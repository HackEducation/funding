<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for June 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $$584.4 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 13</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $44.95 million / Median investment size: $5 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 15</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>We&#8217;re halfway through 2018, which means it&#8217;s time to start thinking about <a href="http://2018trends.hackeducation.com/">what the trends are looking like for the year</a>. Certainly those trends are quite obvious when you look at which companies have received the largest investments so far this year. (See below.)</p>

<p>It may be that 2018 is on track to see more ed-tech investment than in the previous three years (and 2015 was a record-breaking year). But just looking at the total amount of investment is a little deceiving, and this month&#8217;s funding is a good example of this. More dollars went into ed-tech companies this past month than in any month so far this year. But of that $584.4 million, $500 million went to <em>one</em> company, VIPKID. The number of deals in June was actually the lowest it&#8217;s been all year, and the number of deals total is down from the previous few years too.</p>

<p>That means that fewer companies are seeing larger investments, obviously. Consolidation in the market is also evident in the number of acquisitions &#8211; the highest in June than it&#8217;s been all year.</p>

<p>One other interesting trend from June &#8211; and I don&#8217;t want to read too much into this: of the 13 companies that raised venture funding, just 4 were from the US.</p>
