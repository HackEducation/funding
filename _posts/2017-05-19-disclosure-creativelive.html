<p>"CreativeLive Raises $25M to Expand 'Artistic Entrepreneurship' Education Platform," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-18-creativelive-raises-25m-to-expand-artistic-entrepreneurship-education-platform">Edsurge wrote on May 19, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and CreativeLive<a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: GSV.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
