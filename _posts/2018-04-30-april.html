<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for XXX:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $331 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 18</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $20.7 million / Median investment size: $4 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 13</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>Money continues to flow into ed-tech, although &#8211; as we have seen in the past few months &#8211; the amount of money is somewhat skewed by a handful of big deals. This month, there were two $100+ million deals &#8211; Knowbox and Connexeo &#8211; accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount of investment.</p>

<p>Also notable this month: two major acquisitions. One was a fire sale &#8211; Edmodo, which was sold for $137.5 million (of which just $15 million was cash) and General Assembly, which sold for a much more health $412 million. </p>
