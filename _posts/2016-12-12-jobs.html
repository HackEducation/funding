<p><em>This article helps provide funding data for <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/jobs.html">part 6</a> of <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">my annual review of the year in ed-tech</a></em></p>

<p>I confess: this wasn&#8217;t a trend that I tracked until the end of the year, and even then I think I&#8217;ve missed a lot of funding announcements from job placement startups. The ones I&#8217;ve listed here are more likely to work with schools and/or students as part of a career services offering. But the sector is much larger than that, obviously.</p>

<p>Investment analyst firm CB Insights has done a better job of tracking this than me. Some of their articles this year on &#8220;human capital management&#8221;:</p>
