<p>Edsurge has published an op-ed, "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-28-a-basic-glossary-to-income-share-agreements-a-new-approach-to-student-finance">A Basic Glossary to Income Share Agreements, a New Approach to Student Finance</a>," penned by the CEO of Vemo Education and by the Vice Provost for Enrollment Management at Purdue. There is no disclosure on the article that Edsurge and Vemo Education <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Learn Capital.</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track on the publication's disclosure issues.</p>

<p>As Edsurge expands its higher education coverage, it's worth following the narratives (and perhaps eventually the products and services) it's promoting to universities.</p>
