<p>"New Profit Dishes Out $1M to 7 Organizations in Personalized Learning Initiative," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-17-new-profit-dishes-out-1m-to-7-organizations-in-personalized-learning-initiative">Edsurge wrote on April 17, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and New Profit <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge">share a funding source</a>: the Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products that it says schools should buy.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this and other disclosure alerts, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/01/02/disclosure">read this blog post.</a></em></p>
