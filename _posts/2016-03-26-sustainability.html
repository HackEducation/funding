<p>As my own records about ed-tech funding only <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">go back a year</a>, I&rsquo;m struggling to answer a question: which ed-tech startups have not raised money in the past couple of years? That&rsquo;s a prelude to the real question, I suppose: which ed-tech startups might be in danger of running out of money?</p>
<p><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">So far this year</a>, investment in ed-tech is way, way down. And it&rsquo;s not just ed-tech either. Across the tech sector, &ldquo;<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/startup-funding-drying-fintech-no-181518504.html">startup funding is dying up</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a little obsessed the last few days, I admit, with the napkin math &ndash; well, mostly speculation &ndash; about how much money ed-tech startups are burning through and how quickly. The recommendation, according to venture capitalist Fred Wilson (back in 2011 at least): <a href="http://avc.com/2011/12/burn-rates-how-much/">have at least $10,000 per employee per month</a> in the bank.</p>
<p>Pick a startup. Look up how much money it&rsquo;s raised (via, say, <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>). Look up how many people are on its team (via, say, the company website). Do the math.</p>
<p>Add to the equation: does the startup have revenue? Could that revenue offset the burn? (How transparent is the startup about its funding and its revenue?)</p>
<p>Also worth asking: how often do you see this company at conferences? Is it a sponsor? Does it have an exhibit booth? The cost of these expenses, after all, can range from the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop.</p>
<p>Are there other signals that we can look for to gauge the health of a company? Perhaps. Perhaps blog and social media activity (although these can easily be &ldquo;fluffed&rdquo;); new feature releases; pivots and re-branding; and/or staffing levels and changes (including reviews from employees via <a href="http://glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a>).</p>
