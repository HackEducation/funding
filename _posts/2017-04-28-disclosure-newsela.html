<p>"Data Sharing Hasn't Been a Concern for Most Newsela Customers -- But Super Users Want More," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-24-data-sharing-hasn-t-been-a-concern-for-most-newsela-customers-but-super-users-want-more">Edsurge wrote on April 24, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Newsela <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Reach Capital and NewSchools Venture Fund.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products that it says schools should buy.</p>
