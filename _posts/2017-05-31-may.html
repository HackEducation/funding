<p>Here is the latest data about &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; for May 2017</p>

<li><strong>Number of investments: 13</strong></li>

<p>The funding total for 2017 remains higher than the two previous years at this stage. <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/03/01/february">It&#8217;s higher, no doubt, because of the $500 million invested in SoFi in February</a>. If you exclude that one investment &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you should, but some folks continue to insist that private loans aren&#8217;t &#8220;ed-tech&#8221; &#8211; then the total funding figure for the year-to-date is up from 2016 (by about $2 million) but down from 2015 (by about $100 million).</p>

<p>Although the amount of money flowing into ed-tech companies might make it appear the sector is still going strong, it&#8217;s worth noting: investment dollars are moving in bigger amounts to fewer companies. The <em>number</em> of investments is down from this time in both 2016 and 2015. The number of <em>acquisitions</em> is also down from previous years.</p>

<p>The companies that have raised the most money so far this year are:</p>

<ul>
<li>SoFi ($500,000,000 for student loans)</li>
<li>EverFi ($190,000,000 for online skills training)</li>
<li>Grammarly ($110,000,000 for grammar and spell-check)</li>
<li>Xueba100.com ($100,000,000 for &#8220;homework help&#8221;)</li>
<li>AltSchool ($40,000,000 for a private school chain / LMS)</li>
<li>MasterClass ($35,000,000 for online classes taught by celebrities)</li>
<li>College Ave ($30,000,000 for student loans)</li>
<li>BYJU&#8217;s ($30,000,000 for test prep)</li>
<li>MakeBlock ($30,000,000 for robotics)</li>
<li>CreativeLive ($25,000,000 for online skills training)</li>
</ul>

<p>Three of these companies are new to this &#8220;Top 10&#8221; list this month: Grammarly, AltSchool, and CreativeLive.</p>

<p>The top four companies on that list account for about 64% of the money raised so far this year. (And again, if you exclude SoFi, the investments in EverFi, Grammarly, and Xueba100.com constitute about 44% of the money raised so far this year.)</p>
