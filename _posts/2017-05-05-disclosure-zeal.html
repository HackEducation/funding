<p>"Zeal CEO John Danner: Want to Make Data Actionable? Start With Building the Right Culture," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-01-zeal-ceo-john-danner-school-culture-is-key-to-making-data-actionable">Edsurge wrote on May 1, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Zeal <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Reach Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
