<p>I have updated this project with September funding information. As always, the data is freely and openly available <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">via the GitHub repository</a> that powers this site.</p>

<p>The amount of money raised in September was down by almost half from August. But do remember: <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/09/01/august">August saw more money</a> flow into ed-tech than any other month this year. Here are the totals for the month:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount invested: $175,888,870</li>
<li>Number of investments: 21</li>
<li>Average investment size: $9,771,604 / Median: $3,150,000</li>
<li>Number of acquisitions: 9</li>
</ul>

<p>These totals are up significantly from this time last year (although again it&#8217;s worth noting that September was the weakest month for ed-tech investment in 2015). 2016 year-to-date investment totals are ahead of where they were at the close of September of last year. But two of the last three months of 2015 saw funding totals surpass $1 billion. I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ll see a repeat of that this year. There have been about 25% fewer deals so far this year than this time last year; the number of acquisitions is down as well.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the funding in September went to just two startups: BYJU&#8217;s, an Indian test prep site, and Zuoyebang (owned by Baidu), a Chinese homework-help site.</p>
