<p><em>This article is cross-posted to Hack Education</em></p>

<p>There have been several articles in the industry and investor press recently that describe <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ed-tech-startup-market-map/">the ed-tech market</a> as &#8220;<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ed-tech-startup-funding-deals-dollars/">on the rebound</a>,&#8221; with venture capitalists getting their &#8220;<a href="http://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-second-wind-vc-investment-in-edtech-is-rising-again-datagraphic">second wind</a>&#8221; and finding ed-tech once again to be <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-29-from-mexico-to-china-why-the-world-is-interested-in-the-united-states-edtech-market">something worth throwing money at</a>. </p>

<p>Yay.</p>

<p>And indeed, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">according to my calculations</a> too, the amount of money invested in education technology companies is up from this time last year and up from this time in 2015 as well. (And <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/12/23/trends-business">2015 was a record-setting year for ed-tech investment</a>.) </p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, investment analyst firm CB Insights predicts that funding this year <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ed-tech-startup-funding-deals-dollars/">will not exceed that 2015 level</a>, but one of the reasons I like to track the data myself is that everyone&#8217;s numbers and everyone&#8217;s assessment of the industry seem to be different, depending in part on &#8220;what counts&#8221; as ed-tech.</p>

<h3>2017 vs. Previous Years</h3>
<br />
<p>So far this year, there have been 95 investments in ed-tech companies, totaling $1.8 billion. (And yes, I do include student loan companies here. If you&#8217;re an ed-tech analyst and you insist that private student loans are something you shouldn&#8217;t or needn&#8217;t monitor, you&#8217;re not paying attention to what&#8217;s going on.)</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-07-01-total-funding.png"></p>

<p>The average investment this year has been $21.2 million. (The median investment size: $4 million.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison of what funding looked like in Julys of previous years:</p>

<h3>What Kind of Companies Are Raising Money?</h3>
<br />
<p>More than half of deals so far this year have been in what some call &#8220;early stage&#8221; companies &#8211; that is, companies raising seed or their first venture capital funding. </p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-07-01-funding-by-series.png"></p>

<p>But the bulk of dollars have gone to &#8220;late stage&#8221; companies. Companies raising seed funding have raised $55 million so far this year. Companies raising C, D, and F rounds have raised over $1 billion.</p>

<h3>Investment By Country</h3>
<br />
<p>Number of deals by country:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-07-01-country.png"></p>

<p>$1.4 billion in venture capital has gone to US companies so far this year. $280 million has gone to Chinese companies. $34 million has gone to Canadian companies. $25 million has gone to Indian companies.</p>

<h3>What Do These Startups Do?</h3>
<br />
<p>Investors seem to really like &#8220;online education.&#8221; There have been 9 investments so far this year in companies that describe themselves that way &#8211; what a broad description, I realize &#8211; for a total of $320 million.</p>

<p>Tutoring also remains popular: 8 investments totaling $151 million.</p>

<p>There were 4 investments in coding bootcamps, totaling $37.6 million.</p>

<p>The type of startup receiving the most funding: student loan companies, which have raised $540 million so far this year.</p>

<h3>To Whom Are These Startups Selling?</h3>
<br />
<p>Investments in companies serving the K&#8211;12 sector make up the majority of those funded so far this year. (But note: the kinds of companies that get coverage in the ed-tech and tech press &#8211; those that I&#8217;m likely to see and include in my research &#8211; are more likely to be those targeting K&#8211;12 and post-secondary education than those targeting the corporate learning market.)</p>

<h3>The Most Well-Funded Ed-Tech Startups</h3>
<br />
<p>These are the &#8220;startups&#8221; that have raised the most venture capital (That is to say, these companies have not IPO&#8217;d or been acquired so even if they&#8217;re years old, they still sorta count as &#8220;startups&#8221;):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SoFi</strong> (private student loans) &#8211; $1.88 billion</li>
<li><strong>Affirm</strong> (private student loans) &#8211; $420 million</li>

<li><strong>Udemy</strong> (skills training marketplace) &#8211; $173 million</li>
<li><strong>AltSchool</strong> (private school; learning management system) &#8211; $173 million</li>
<li><strong>Kaltura</strong> (video platform) &#8211; $165.1 million</li>

<li><strong>Udacity</strong> (skills training) &#8211; $160 million</li>
<li><strong>Knewton</strong> (algorithmic textbooks) &#8211; $157.25 million</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Most Active Investors of 2017</h3>
<br />
<p>Most of the investors who&#8217;ve participated in the 96 deals so far this year have only participated in one ed-tech deal. There are just 9 firms that have invested in three or more deals so far this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reach Capital</strong> (2017 investments: AdmitHub, Holberton School, Nearpod, Epic!, BookNook, Mystery Science, Mrs. Wordsmith, Abl)</li>
<li><strong>GSV</strong> (Voxy, Raise.me, MasterClass, CreativeLive, Nearpod, Coursera, Motimatic)</li>
<li><strong>University Ventures</strong> (investments: AdmitHub, OOHLALA, Motimatic, Examity, CollegeVine (formerly Admissions Hero), and Paragon One)</li>
<li><strong>Y Combinator</strong> (investments: OOHLALA, Paragon One, KidPass, Outschool, Mystery Science)</li>
<li><strong>Learn Capital</strong> (investments: Paragon One, Outschool, Mystery Science, Coursera)</li>
<li><strong>First Round</strong> (investments: Wonderschool, CareDox, Abl)</li>
<li><strong>FundersClub</strong> (investments: AdmitHub, Outschool, Wonderschool)</li>
<li><strong>Owl Ventures</strong> (investments: Lingo Live, Raise.me,Abl)</li>
<li><strong>Rethink Education</strong> (investments: Voxy, Abl, Trilogy Education)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do note the overlap in their investments &#8211; the &#8220;herd mentality&#8221; of venture capitalists.</p>

<h3>Ed-Tech Exits</h3>
<br />
<p>There are only a couple of outcomes once a company has raised venture capital. I mean, it has to pay its investors back. So either it gets acquired, merges with another company, goes public, or goes away.</p>

<p>There have been 40 acquisitions so far this year. This is down from 68 this time last year and down from 64 this time in 2015. </p>

<p>Companies that were actively acquiring startups in previous years &#8211; Blackboard, Pearson, and PowerSchool for example &#8211; have not bought any startups this year. (Frontline Education, which bought five startups last year, has acquired just one so far in 2017.)</p>

<p>Only one education company has gone public this year: Laureate Education, which raised $490 million with its initial public offering.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<br />
<p>Stating that the amount of ed-tech investment is up so far this year doesn&#8217;t really tell us much about what ed-tech really looks like. No doubt, we should ask <em>why</em> it&#8217;s up &#8211; why are investors re-enthused about education companies (particularly when successful exits seem to be slumping)? What role do education politics play in ed-tech investment? (Private student loans. Coding bootcamps. Betsy DeVos. Donald Trump. For-profit universities. Voucher programs. Online charter schools. And so on&#8230;)</p>
