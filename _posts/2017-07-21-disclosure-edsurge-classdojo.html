<p>Edsurge has posted a story, "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-18-at-louisville-summer-camps-robots-meets-literacy-to-support-vulnerable-students">At Louisville Summer Camps, Robots Meet Literacy to Support Vulnerable Students</a>" and does disclose that it's part of a research series paid for by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. At least one of the products featured in this story shares investors with Edsurge. This is precisely the sort of marketing I think makes Edsurge so problematic. ClassDojo and Edsurge share the following investors: GSV, Learn Capital, NewSchools Venture Fund, and Reach Capital.</p>

<p><em>Note: I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</em></p>
