<p>As the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/net-neutrality-goes-down-in-flames-as-fcc-votes-to-kill-title-ii-rules/">moves forward with its efforts to scrap &#8220;net neutrality,&#8221;</a> I thought it might be worthwhile to list the education technology companies that have raised money from ISPs. After all, if there is &#8220;preferential treatment&#8221; on the Internet, it&#8217;s worth thinking about how this will affect schools&#8217; access to various education technology products and services.</p>

<p>(I should note: this is an incomplete list. It doesn&#8217;t include all the funds, for example, that these large companies contribute to. It doesn&#8217;t include the investments of their executives past and present &#8211; Steve Case&#8217;s investment portfolio, for example.)</p>

<li>Viridis Learning (&#8220;skills matching&#8221; company)</li>
<li>Kiwi Crate (&#8220;STEM&#8221; subscription box)</li>
</ul>

<p>Comcast also partnered with Khan Academy to promote the latter&#8217;s online videos as part of the former&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3023560/fast-feed/comcast-khan-academy-announce-multi-million-dollar-partnership">Internet Essentials program</a> for low-income families.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T runs a startup accelerator program called AT&amp;T Aspire. Among the companies <a href="http://about.att.com/content/csr/home/blog/2017/05/introducing_the_2017.html">in this year&#8217;s cohort</a>:</p>

<li>LitLab (surveilling students&#8217; mobile data usage and giving to parents)</li>
<li>Zulama (game design)</li>
</ul>

<p>Edsurge has also received money from the AT&amp;T Aspire program to report on &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-12-07-how-are-schools-changing-edsurge-unveils-final-chapter-of-yearlong-state-of-edtech-report">the state of ed-tech</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank focused on privacy issues, is also <a href="https://fpf.org/about/supporters/">financially supported</a> by AT&amp;T and Comcast (along with Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others).</p>

<p>AT&T is also a <a href="https://www.educause.edu/about/corporate-participation/membership/corporate-partner-program/our-partners">sponsor of EDUCAUSE</a>.</p>
