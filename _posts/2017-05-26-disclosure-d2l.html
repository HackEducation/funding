<p>"Real Life Learning: An Up Close Look at Competency-Based Education," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/research/guides/real-life-learning-an-up-close-look-at-competency-based-education">by Edsurge</a>, with sponsorship from D2L. There is no disclosure on the landing page for the guide (nor <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-22-why-there-s-little-consistency-in-defining-competency-based-education">on individual articles in it</a>) that the two companies <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Graham Holdings.</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track on the publication's disclosure issues.</p>
