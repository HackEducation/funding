<p><em>These are the investments and acquisitions related to part nine of my year-in-review series &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/robots-and-children.html">Robots Are Coming For Your Children</a>.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>More money has gone into tutoring startups than any other kind of education company this year. And from what we know about how tutoring exacerbates inequality &#8211; that is, how it&#8217;s an additional product or service that some families can afford to pay for while others cannot &#8211; this isn&#8217;t a good signal.</p>

<p>Most of the funding in this sector went to companies from China or India.</p>
