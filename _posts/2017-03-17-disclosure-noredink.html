<p>"NoRedInk Adds New Exercises to Prepare Students for ACT, SAT," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-03-15-noredink-adds-new-exercises-to-prepare-students-for-act-sat">Edsurge wrote on March 15, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and NoRedInk <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge">share an investor</a>: Learn Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products to them.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this and other disclosure alerts, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/01/02/disclosure">read this blog post.</a></em></p>
