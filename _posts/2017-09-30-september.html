<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; for September 2017:</p>

<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 6</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>The amount of money invested so far this year remains higher than at the same time in 2016 and 2015. (Indeed, the amount invested so far this year has now surpassed the total raised in 2016.) But the number of investment deals has fallen. That means that the growth in ed-tech funding is being driven by a small number of very large investments &#8211; there have been nine of $100 million or more.</p>

<p>Acquisitions are also down from previous years &#8211; only 62 so far this year compared to 86 this time last year and 77 the year before.</p>

<p>About 60% of venture capital dollars this year &#8211; roughly $1.6 billion &#8211; have gone to US companies. About 30% have gone to Chinese companies &#8211; roughly $790 million. </p>
