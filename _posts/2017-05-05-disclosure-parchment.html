<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-02-blackboard-co-founder-four-secrets-to-building-a-tech-company-for-higher-ed">Edsurge reprints</a> a blog post written by Blackboard founder Matthew Pittinsky. Pittinsky is also the founder of Parchment. The Edsurge article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Parchment <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: GSV Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
