<p>Beginning December 2018, I am taking a break from regular updates to Hack Education (in the form of the &#8220;Hack Education Weekly News&#8221; and the monthly &#8220;Business of Ed-Tech&#8221; venture funding analysis, specifically). </p>

<p>This project will also be dormant.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll pick it up after I&#8217;ve finished writing <em>Teaching Machines</em>. Maybe I won&#8217;t. </p>
