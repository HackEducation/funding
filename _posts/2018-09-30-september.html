<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for September:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $93.4 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 7</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $23.3 million / Median investment size: $5.6 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 6</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 0</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>What just happened?! There were only 7 investment deals, according to my records at least, in September. Three of these did not disclose the amount of money that was raised, so the investment total of $93.4 million isn&#8217;t quite right (and is comprised almost entirely of the $80 million raised by celebrity &#8220;teaching&#8221; platform Masterclass). </p>

<p>That figure doesn&#8217;t make September 2018 the lowest month for investment dollars since I&#8217;ve been keeping track. That was back in September 2015. But this month was the lowest in dollars invested since November 2016, and it was the lowest month &#8211; again, since I&#8217;ve been keeping track&#8211; in terms of the number of investments made.</p>

<p>2018 does still appear to be on track to be a strong year in terms of the amount of money invested in education startups. But the number of investments is way, way down.</p>

<p>Perhaps the tech industry&#8217;s billionaires are opting to go the &#8220;<a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/bezos-family-foundation/investments.html">philanthropy</a>&#8221; route instead of the VC one. I have created a new page here on this site to show where the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative money is going. (This is not easy to track as the company is not a foundation and therefore not transparent about its &#8220;giving.&#8221;)</p>

<h3>The Biggest Investments of 2018 (So Far)</h3>
<br />
<p>This list has not changed since last month,  but here is is nonetheless: the companies that have raised the most money in 2018:</p>

<li><strong>Zuoyebang</strong> (tutoring): $350 million</li>
