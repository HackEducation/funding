<p><a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">2015 was a record-setting year for ed-tech investment</a>. But funding has fallen off precipitously since the calendar rolled over to 2016. There have been predictions all year long that the ed-tech boom has turned to bust. Startup funding totals are about $350 million behind where they were this time last year. At the end of June 2015, there had been 122 investments; so far this year, there have been 107.</p>

<p>As investors have become more parsimonious, ed-tech companies have had to tighten their belts. God forbid, they&#8217;ve had to come up with a business model. There have been a number of high profile layoffs and pivots so far this year (and not just at small startups, but at big tech companies too), and I think there are still serious questions about the <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/03/26/sustainability">sustainability</a> of several high profile ed-tech startups. Even Edsurge, which typically only has good news for entrepreneurs, recently (and cautiously) asked &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-21-can-edmodo-turn-virality-into-profitability">Can Edmodo Turn Virality into Profitability?</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the problems that tech companies (in general) have faced this year is <a href="http://fortune.com/silicon-valley-tech-ipo-market/">the grim outlook for IPOs</a>. Only one education company has IPO&#8217;d so far this year, <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-online-education-group-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-300282925.html">China Online Education</a>, which became a publicly traded company just this month. The other path a startup can take for a &#8220;successful exit&#8221; is the acquisition, and acquisitions are up from this time last year. (Popular acquisition targets: coding bootcamps and learning management systems.)</p>
