<p>"Panorama's Student Progress Reports Show More Than Grades (Think Behavior and SEL)," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-20-panorama-s-student-progress-reports-show-more-than-grades-think-behavior-and-sel">Edsurge wrote on April 20, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Panorama <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge">share an investor</a>: Imagine K-12.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products that it says schools should buy.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this and other disclosure alerts, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/01/02/disclosure">read this blog post.</a></em></p>
