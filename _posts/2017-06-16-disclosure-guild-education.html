<p>Edsurge conducted a series of interviews at the ASU-GSV Summit this spring. <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-15-how-to-help-new-normal-students-get-their-careers-and-education-rolling">One posted this week with the CEO of Guild Education</a> fails to disclose that the two companies <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share an investor</a>: 1776.</p> Now that I think of it, there's no disclosure in any of Edsurge's write-ups from ASU-GSV that GSV is an investor too.

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</p>
