<p>Although I&#8217;ve been maintaining spreadsheets with all ed-tech funding for a couple of years now, I haven&#8217;t done a great job making this data in any other formats than 1) my own verbiage or 2) JSON files. As part of the work I will do with my <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/31/spencer-fellow">Spencer Fellowship</a>, I&#8217;m working to make more of this spreadsheet data power HTML pages.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to take me a week or so to put all my data in the right format. You can find the repositories I&#8217;m working on, as usual, on GitHub. (I&#8217;ve set up a new organization for this project: <a href="https://github.com/Hack-Education-Data">Hack-Education-Data</a>.)</p>

<p>Coming soon: pages detailing ed-tech investments, investors, mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs. For now:</p>

<p><a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/deadpool.html"><strong>The Ed-Tech Startup Deadpool</strong></a> &#8211; that is, all the companies that have gone out-of-business since 2013. </p>

<p>Obviously this isn&#8217;t a complete list, and I&#8217;ll add more historical data over time. And once I have a better handle on this whole process, I&#8217;ll write out some instructions on how you can contribute to the research and/or re-use the data.</p>
