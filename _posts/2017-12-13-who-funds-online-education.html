<p><em>These are the investments and acquisitions related to part six of my year-in-review series &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/online-education.html">Education&#8217;s Online Futures</a>.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>There are several challenges to my research into startup funding. One: I&#8217;m quite dependent on how these companies describe themselves. I don&#8217;t have time to review everyone&#8217;s product to see what they really do. Another: some of the keywords and descriptions companies use are so broad to be meaningless. &#8220;Online education&#8221; is a perfect example. I&#8217;m guessing many, many of the companies that raised money this year fall into this bucket. That is, you need an Internet connection in order to be able to access their product or service. But what I have included here are really just those companies that say they offer <em>online classes</em>. (Tutoring will be covered in a subsequent article.)</p>
