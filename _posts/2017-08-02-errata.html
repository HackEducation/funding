<p>After I published my report yesterday on July&#8217;s ed-tech funding totals, I received an email letting me know I was missing a handful of the <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/03/06/931937/0/en/LearnLaunch-Accelerator-Companies-Collectively-Raise-More-Than-10-Million-in-the-First-Quarter-of-2017.html">companies who&#8217;d been part of the LearnLaunch Accelerator program</a>. So I&#8217;ve updated the GitHub repositories that contain the list of <a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/investors/">all ed-tech investors</a> and the list of <a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/investments/">all ed-tech investments</a> with this data.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably worth restating that it&#8217;s a bit challenging to get accurate data. I rely a lot on <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>, but there are a lot of gaps in their data. Some companies don&#8217;t publicize how much money they&#8217;ve raised; some don&#8217;t publicize who they&#8217;ve raised money from. Sometimes I just don&#8217;t see the press release, and I don&#8217;t even know to look a company up on Crunchbase. (I do have plans to incorporate SEC data in this project. But I&#8217;m just one person here, working without venture funding.)</p>

<p>There are issues too, as I often note, with &#8220;what counts&#8221; as ed-tech. Do student loan startups count? What happens when a company pivots into or away from education?</p>

<p>And I make mistakes. All the time. </p>

<p>With that in mind, here are some updated numbers from previous months and years. (Updated, but still incomplete):</p>
