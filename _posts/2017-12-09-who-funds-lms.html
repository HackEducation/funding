<p><em>This article offers more information about <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/platforms.html">part five</a> of my annual review of the year-in-ed-tech. Here are some of the details about who&#8217;s investing in learning management systems:</em></p>

<p>In June, Edsurge published a story titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-17-stale-words-and-hackneyed-ideas-that-make-edtech-investors-cringe">Stale Words and Hackneyed Ideas That Make Edtech Investors Cringe</a>&#8221; &#8211; advice to entrepreneurs on what sorts of ideas venture capitalists like and dislike. Among the tips, stay away from &#8220;graveyard ideas&#8221; like the learning management system. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s not great advice, particularly if you note that learning management systems were among the types of companies raising the most money this year. (Okay, okay. That&#8217;s because I now count AltSchool as an LMS.)</p>

<h3>Investments in Learning Management Systems</h3>
<br />
<p>Smartup.io raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-02-15-mobile-micro-learning-management-system-receives-5-5-million-in-seed-a-funding">$5.5 million</a> in February from Notion Capital and Hong Leong Group. </p>

<p>AltSchool raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/altschool">$40 million</a> in May from undisclosed investors. The private school startup (turned LMS) has raised $173 million total.</p>

<p>Absorb Software raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-09-11-canadian-lms-developer-raises-59-million-from-boston-investor">$59 million</a> from Silversmith Capital Partners in September.</p>

<p>Moodle raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-10-02-the-world-s-most-popular-lms-provider-moodle-raises-money-for-the-1st-time">$9 million</a> in October from Education For the Many.</p>

<h3>Acquisitions in the LMS Industry</h3>
<br />
<p>The Volaris Group <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k-12-dealmaking-volaris-acquires-edumate-moodle-raises-funds/">acquired</a> the LMS Edumate in October. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>Instructure <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-12-02-we-talkin-about-practice-instructure-acquires-video-based-learning-platform">acquired</a> the video-based assessment platform Practice in December. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps notable that Blackboard, one of the top acquirers of startups in previous years, did not make any acquisitions this year.</p>
