<p>Just a quick note to say that I have updated <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">my list of all education-related grants by the Gates Foundation</a> &#8211; issued through June 2018, that is. By my calculations, the foundation has made some $62 million in grants so far in 2018, which strikes me as quite low <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">compared to previous years</a>.</p>

<p>My calculations could be wrong because it&#8217;s become quite a bit more difficult to pull this data from the Gates Foundation website. Its search filters no longer seem to work; and even when they do, it appears that many of the education-related topics now fall into other categories. &#8220;Transparency.&#8221;</p>

<p>(My favorite grant from June 2018: to the University of Chicago for $52,000 for &#8220;TBD.&#8221;)</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation has announced that it&#8217;s changing how it handles its education investments. And it&#8217;s partnering with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for some of this work, a company that is even <em>less</em> transparent &#8211; it&#8217;s not a foundation, so it needn&#8217;t be. I&#8217;ll still try to maintain this project because I think it&#8217;s important to be able to look and see how influential these billionaire-philanthropists are in shaping education policy and education narratives.</p>
