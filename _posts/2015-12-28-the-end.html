<p><em>This post first appeared on <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">matrix.hackeducation.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G5vM1m5KUy_Q6N4oiNyo9rEnjcYBVT4RB3eyjmE0ao/edit?usp=sharing">Google spreadsheet</a> detailing the year&#8217;s investments and acquisitions in education companies one final time. And I&#8217;ve exported the data (in JSON format) too; it can be found <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">in this project&#8217;s repo on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>According to my calculations, these are the startups that raised the most money in ed-tech in 2015:</p>

<ol>
<li>Social Finance ($1 billion)</li>
<li>Earnest ($275 million)</li>
<li>HotChalk ($230 million)</li>
<li>Social Finance ($200 million)</li>
<li>TutorGroup ($200 million)</li>
<li>Lynda.com ($186 million)</li>
<li>Hujang.com ($157 million)</li>
<li>Udacity ($105 million)</li>
<li>17zuoye and AltSchool (tied with $100 million each)</li>
<li>Xioazhan Jiaoyu ($84 million)</li>
<li>General Assembly ($70 million)</li>
<li>Udemy ($65 million)</li>
<li>Yuantiku ($60 million)</li>
<li>Civitas Learning ($60 million)</li>
<li>NetDragon Education ($52.5 million)</li>
<li>Genshuixue and Varsity Tutors (tied with $50 million each)</li>
<li>Coursera ($49.5 million)</li>
<li>Knewton ($47.25 million)</li>
<li>Ortbotix and Duolingo (tied with $45 million each)</li>
<li>LittleBits ($44.2 million)</li>
</ol>

<p>Total ed-tech investment for 2015: $4,347,226,000-ish.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already written a few thousand words analyzing &#8220;<a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">The Business of Ed-Tech</a>,&#8221; but I have a few more thoughts about this particular project.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I&#8217;m going to start next year with a new GitHub repo and website where I&#8217;ll track on ed-tech funding: the appropriately titled <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>. I have a better sense of what I did well and what I did poorly this year.</p>

<p>Next year, I&#8217;ll track a little bit more data, including the countries of the companies raising money. I also plan to have a one or two word category description for each company (eg &#8220;test prep,&#8221; &#8220;tutoring,&#8221; &#8220;student loans,&#8221; and other things investors seem to love). I&#8217;ll also indicate if the company&#8217;s products are marketed to schools, teachers, students (and parents), or other businesses. I&#8217;ll indicate if the company is pitched at the K&#8211;12, post-secondary, corporate training level. And I&#8217;ll list the total each company has raised. Hopefully this will become a lot more useful of a project once the data collection gets better.</p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m not going to use Google for next year&#8217;s project. It&#8217;s not been reliable once the size of the file has grown. I&#8217;ll (likely) use Excel. I will continue to make JSON files available, and I&#8217;ll probably post a CSV regularly as well.</p>
