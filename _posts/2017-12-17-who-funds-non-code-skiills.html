<p><em>These are the investments and acquisitions related to part eight of my year-in-review series &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/robots-jobs.html">Robots Are Coming For Your Jobs</a>.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Although much of the talk about &#8220;skills training&#8221; is code (pardon the pun) for <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/12/17/who-funds-learn-to-code">computer science instruction</a>, there were investments this year in companies that don&#8217;t just teach programming.</p>

<p>Of particular note: the investment in EverFi in April. Not only was it one of the largest rounds of funding this year &#8211; <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/04/26/bono-tpg-rise-everfi/">$190 million</a> &#8211; but it also underscores some of the narratives (from education reformers and education investors and politicians alike) that there are major gaps in the curriculum when it comes to &#8220;soft skills.&#8221; EverFi provides a platform for schools and businesses to teach short courses on topics like alcohol and drug abuse and sexual harassment. With all the stories about sexual assault and harassment in the news this year, it will be worth keeping an eye on EverFi and how it positions itself as a &#8220;solution.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sexual-harassment-training-effective-2017-11">Research suggests that much sexual harassment training doesn&#8217;t work</a>.)</p>
