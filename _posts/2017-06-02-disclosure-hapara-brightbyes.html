<p>Edsurge reports that "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-31-brightbytes-tried-to-buy-hapara-then-a-better-offer-and-a-legal-complaint-emerged">BrightBytes Tried to Buy Hapara. Then a Better Offer -- and a Legal Complaint -- Emerged</a>." There is no disclosure on the article that Edsurge shares investors <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">both of these companies</a>: ImagineK12 has invested in Edsurge and Hapara, and Learn Capital and NewSchools Venture Fund have invested in both Edsurge and BrightBytes.</p>

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems.</p>
