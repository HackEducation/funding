<p>I realize it&#8217;s not quite the end of the month, and perhaps there will be a few more investments announced before the year comes to a close. Nonetheless, here is the latest (we&#8217;ll call it &#8220;preliminary&#8221;) data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for December 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $608.86 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 15</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $43.49 million / Median investment size: $5 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 8</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>About three-quarters of the total amount this month raised went to one company: Indian test-prep provider BYJUs.</p>

<p>Note: I did not include Juul&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/22/juul-me-twice-shame-on-you/">$12.8 billion investment</a> from Marlboro in this month&#8217;s calculations, even though I very much want to count the Juul as ed-tech due to its <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/juul-offered-schools-as-much-as-20000-to-teach-a-curriculum">&#8220;mindfulness&#8221; curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have more analysis in a final look at the year in the business of ed-tech soon.</p>
