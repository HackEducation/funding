<p>Edsurge offers <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-10-what-a-reinvented-college-looks-like-4-alternative-higher-ed-models">â€‹What a Reinvented College Looks Like: 4 Alternative Higher-Ed Models</a>: Minerva, MissionU, "New Research University," "New Urban College." There's no disclosure that Edsurge shares investors with one of these models: The Minerva Project, which like Edsurge, is backed by Learn Capital. 

<p><em>Note: I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</em></p>
