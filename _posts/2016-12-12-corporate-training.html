<p><em>This article helps provide funding data for <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/jobs.html">part 6</a> of <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">my annual review of the year in ed-tech</a></em></p>

<p>According to the data I track on education technology startups, more investments flow to those who sell to K&#8211;12 than to higher education or to corporations. But I think that&#8217;s likely a flaw with how I gather my data &#8211; relying on publications like Edsurge, for example, to rewrite funding press releases. Corporate training is big business.</p>

<p>Those startups raising money this year to deliver corporate training include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ExpertKnowledge ($750,000) &#8211; investors include The Edge Edtech Fund and Thought into Action Ventures</li>
<li>Grovo ($40,000,000) &#8211; investors include Accel Partners, Costanoa Venture Capital, SoftTech VC, Greg Waldorf, and Vayner Capital</li>
<li>OpenSesame ($9,000,000) &#8211; investors include Altos Ventures and Partech Ventures</li>
<li>Coorpacademy ($11,000,000) &#8211; investors include Debiopharm Group, NextStage, and Serena Capital</li>
<li>Everwise ($16,000,000) &#8211; investors include Canvas Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Webb Investment Network</li>
</ul>
