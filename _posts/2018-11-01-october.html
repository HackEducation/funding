<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for October 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $242.6 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 12</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $20.2 million / Median investment size: $11 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 10</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of spinoffs: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>Although the amount of money invested in education companies ticked up this month (following very low levels of investment in August and September), it&#8217;s worth noting that almost half of the total invested went to one company: BYJU&#8217;s. This is a test-prep/tutoring company, and this sub-sector of education companies remains the best funded &#8211; this year as in previous ones. Just a reminder: tutoring exacerbates inequality by expecting families to pay for education (as opposed to, say, publicly funding high quality education for everyone). So congrats to everyone who&#8217;s in on this one, notably this month Arielle Zuckerberg &#8211; yes, that&#8217;s Mark&#8217;s little sister. And yes, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is one of BYJU&#8217;s many investors</p>
