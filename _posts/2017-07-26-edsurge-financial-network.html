<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge#/entity">According to Crunchbase</a>, Edsurge has raised $5.66 million in venture capital since 2012. (The list of investors in Crunchbase do not match <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">the list of investors on Edsurge&#8217;s website</a>.) Edsurge&#8217;s backers are some of the most active investors in ed-tech startups more generally, raising a lot of questions about the &#8220;independence&#8221; the company claims in its coverage of the industry.</p>

<p>Edsurge has also received a number of grants. Its Gates Foundation grants, for example, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">total $5.2 million</a>. The Gates Foundation has also funded several of Edsurge&#8217;s investors, including NewSchools Venture Fund and Reach Capital. </p>

<p>(It&#8217;s worth noting: Edsurge also takes sponsorship dollars from the industry in order to research and write articles, as well as to appear at its conferences. This project is a work in progress, and I have not yet pulled all the data from the Edsurge website to assess who has sponsored content or conference booths.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created a page on this site that list Edsurge&#8217;s investors, as part of my larger investigations into the financial, political, and social networks that are shaping education technology: <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/edsurge.html">The Edsurge Network</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/blog/">making note this year</a> when Edsurge fails to disclose the ties it might have to investors and to investors&#8217; portfolios it covers. (It happens a lot, but then again, almost every article would need a disclosure.) I&#8217;m going to stop writing about that here on this site, but I will continue to tweet about this with the <a href="http://disclosedtech">@disclosedtech</a> account.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/2017-07-26-network.png" align="right" style="margin:10px">I&#8217;d really like to be able to graph some of the connections among investors, companies, people, products, policies, and PR, and I think that Edsurge has tried to position itself in the center of many of these conversations.</p>
