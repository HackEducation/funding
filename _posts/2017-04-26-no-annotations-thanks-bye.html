<p>I have added a <a href="https://github.com/samboy/genius-blocker">script</a> to my websites today that will block annotations &#8211; namely those from Genius and those from Hypothes.is. I have been meaning to do this for a while now, so it&#8217;s mostly a project that comes as I procrastinate doing something else rather than one that comes in response to any recent event. </p>

<p>I <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/16/the-comments-are-closed">took comments of my websites in 2013</a> because I was sick of having to wade through threats of sexualized violence in order to host conversations on my ideas. </p>

<p>My blog. My rules. No comments. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made this position fairly well known &#8211; if you have something to say in response, go ahead and write your own blog post on your own damn site. So I find the idea that someone would use a service like Hypothes.is to annotate my work on my websites particularly frustrating. <em>I don&#8217;t want comments</em> &#8211; not in the margins and not at the foot of an article. Mostly, I don&#8217;t want to have to moderate them. I have neither the time nor the emotional bandwidth. And if I don&#8217;t want to moderate comments, that means I definitely do not want comments to appear here (or that appear to be here) that are <a href="https://ellacydawson.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/how-news-genius-silences-writers/">outside my control</a> or even my sight. </p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t simply about trolls and bigots threatening me (although yes, that is a huge part of it); it&#8217;s about extracting value from my work and shifting it to another (<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/04/14/omidyar">for-profit</a>) company which then gets to control (and monetize) the conversation.</p>

<p>Blocking annotation tools does not stop you from annotating my work. I&#8217;m a fan of marginalia; I am. Blocking annotations stops you from writing in the margins here on this website.</p>
