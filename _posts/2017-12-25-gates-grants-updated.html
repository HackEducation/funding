<p>I have updated &#8220;<a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">The History of the Gates Foundation</a>&#8221; timeline to reflect this year&#8217;s statements from Bill Gates about how the organization&#8217;s education efforts are &#8220;evolving.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also updated the totals for the grant money it distributed this year: $235 million. You can see the list of these grants at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html</a>.</p>

<p>I will be writing more about the year in venture capital and venture philanthropy in the next few days, and addressing the Gates Foundation&#8217;s role in shaping education policies and education narratives. One thing I noticed: the number of &#8220;social and emotional learning&#8221; initiatives that received money late in the year. </p>
