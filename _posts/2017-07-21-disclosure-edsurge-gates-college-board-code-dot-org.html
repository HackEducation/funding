<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-18-students-and-teachers-on-twitter-celebrate-record-numer-of-computer-science-exam-testers">Edsurge was one of the many publications</a> this week touting the Code.org press release which, in turn, touted the work it had done to boost the number of students taking AP exams in Computer Science. The College Board, which runs the AP exam, Code.org, and Edsurge are all funded by the Gates Foundation, but there's no disclosure anywhere to that end. Shocking. I know.</p>

<p><em>Note: I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</em></p>
