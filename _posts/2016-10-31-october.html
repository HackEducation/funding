<p>I have updated this project with October funding information. As always, the data is freely and openly available <a href="https://github.com/hackeducation/funding/tree/gh-pages/data">via the GitHub repository</a> that powers this site.</p>

<p>I should note that I&#8217;ve revised a little bit how I calculate each month&#8217;s totals. I no longer count debt financing. If I did, the $100,000,000 raised by private loan company Affirm would be the largest amount raised this month. I&#8217;ve gone back through previous months and adjusted the figures, which brings the totals down for June and April.</p>

<p>The amount of money raised in October was the lowest of any month so far this year: $111 million. The number of deals and the number of acquisitions were also the lowest they&#8217;ve been all year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount invested: $111,370,000</li>
<li>Number of investments: 13</li>
<li>Average investment size: $8,566,923 / Median: $4,000,000</li>
<li>Number of acquisitions: 7</li>
<li>Number of mergers: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>The ed-tech startups that have raised the most this year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Age of Learning ($150,000,000)</li>
<li>BYJU&#8217;s ($125,000,000)</li>
<li>Vipkid and Affirm ($100,000,000)</li>
<li>Incred ($75,000,000)</li>
<li>Zuoyebang, Udemy, and Student.com ($60,000,000)</li>
<li>Kaltura ($50,000,000)</li>
<li>Galvanize and Matific ($45,000,000)</li>
<li>Panopto ($42,800,000)</li>
<li>Everfi, Jerry Education, Edlio, and Grovo ($40,000,000)</li>
<li>CommonBond and Codecademy ($30,000,000)</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m going to hold off on in-depth analysis for now, as I&#8217;m about to switch gears and start work on my &#8220;<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">year in review</a>&#8221; articles. But I will note: it certainly appears as though &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; is far worse off &#8211; in terms of venture capital, at least &#8211; this year than it was in the big boom days of 2015. The amount of money invested and number of deals are both about 65% of what they were at the end of October 2015. By the end of December, the comparison could look even worse, as there was over a billion dollars invested in November 2015 and I&#8217;m not sure I foresee that happening this year.</p>
