<p>Edsurge publishes analysis on MOOCs written by Class Central's Dhawal Shah: "<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-06-moocs-find-their-audience-professional-learners-and-universities">â€‹MOOCs Find Their Audience: Professional Learners and Universities</a>." <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/04/21/disclosure-class-central">I've noted before</a> the failure to disclose the shared investors here: both Class Central and Edsurge are funded by ImagineK12. <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/02/17/disclosure-coursera">As I've (also) previously pointed out</a>, Edsurge also shares investors with Coursera: Learn Capital and GSV Capital. Edsurge also shares an investor with Udacity: Steve Blank. </p>

<p>Funny how narratives about the revolutionary potential of MOOCs get spread by "the media," eh?</p>

<p><em>Note: I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</em></p>
