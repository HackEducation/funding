<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for the month of December:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $109.95 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 10</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $10.9 million / Median investment size: $7 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 11</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>December wasn&#8217;t the slowest month of the year in terms of the number of investments. (That was April, with 9.) But it was the month with the least amount of dollars flowing into ed-tech companies.</p>

<p>Errata: while I&#8217;d listed an investment in WorldStrides <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/11/30/november">in my November roundup</a>, it turns out that money was actually an acquisition. Oops. $500 million is a big mistake to make. I&#8217;ve updated all my calculations to reflect this. </p>

<p>You can read more analysis about &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; in 2017 on <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">2017trends.hackeducation.com</a>. But here are some of the totals for the year:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested in 2017: $3.48 billion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 198</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $19 million / Median investment size: $5 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 86</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 4</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of investment is up from last year by over $1 billion. But it&#8217;s down from the record-setting year in 2015 &#8211; down by about a billion from then. The number of deals this year is also down from the two previous years, as is the number of acquisitions.</p>

<h3>The Biggest Investments of 2017</h3>
<br />

<h3>The Most Active Acquirers in 2017</h3>

<p>No large company went on a startup-buying streak this year. That is to say, no one bought more than two companies. Chegg, for example, bought refMe and Cogeon. Elsevier bought Plum Analytics and bepress. Thomas Bravo bought Frontline Education which bought Teachers-Teachers and School Improvement Network in turn.</p>

<h3>2017&#8217;s Education Mergers</h3>
<br />
<p>There were just a handful of mergers this year, and none as high profile as the joining of for-profit colleges Strayer Education and Capella Education.</p>

<p>Other mergers: Taskstream with Tk20; InsideTrack with Strada Education; and Code/Interactive with Mouse.</p>

<h3>2017&#8217;s Education Spinoffs</h3>
<br />
<p>There was one spinoff this year: Voyage, which spun off of parent company Udacity.</p>

<h3>2017&#8217;s Education IPOs</h3>
<br />
<p>There were four (!!!) education IPOs this year: for-profit college chain Laureate Education (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAUR/">LAUR</a>); private preschool company RYB Education (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RYB">RYB</a>); English language learning company Rise Education Cayman (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REDU">REDU</a>); and tutoring company Four Seasons Education (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FEDU">FEDU</a>).</p>

<p>Also notable: Saint Francis High School in California that invested $15,000 in a seed round of Snap in 2012. It sold two-thirds of its shares this year when Snap IPO&#8217;d, <a href="https://qz.com/923281/saint-francis-high-school-in-mountain-view-california-turned-a-15000-snap-investment-into-a-multi-million-dollar-payday/">earning some $24 million</a>. </p>

<h3>The 2017 Ed-Tech Deadpool</h3>
<br />
<p>Four education companies joined the &#8220;deadpool&#8221; this year: Yik Yak, The Iron Yard, Dev Bootcamp, and TechShop. </p>

<p>Yik Yak had raised some $73 million in venture capital before folding. The Iron Yard and Dev Bootcamp, both coding bootcamps, had been acquired by for-profit colleges (Apollo Education Group and Kaplan respectively) who opted not to keep the lights on.</p>
