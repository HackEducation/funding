Unfortunately, it&#8217;s very hard to track where it&#8217;s spending its money as it does not always post that information publicly.

It has funded a series on Edsurge, promoting &#8220;personalized learning.&#8221; It has also backed the <a href="https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/05/chan_zuckerberg_initiative_chiefs_for_change_personalized_learning.html">Chiefs for Change education reform group</a>.</p>
