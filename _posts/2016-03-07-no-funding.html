<p><em>This article first appeared <a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/which-ed-tech-startups-havent-raised-money-lately">on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>Last week, the investment analysts at CB Insights released a <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/venture-capital-trends-CB-Insights.pdf">report</a> on venture capital trends, noting that the number of ed-tech deals are declining. This is echoed in <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/02/29/february">my own calculations</a> about recent trends in ed-tech funding.</p>
<p>But CB Insights&rsquo; report has also made me think about the converse of the questions that I&rsquo;ve been asking about ed-tech investment &ndash; who&rsquo;s raising money, and how much? That is: which companies are <em>not</em> raising money, and which haven&rsquo;t in quite some time?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of a way to pursue this line of inquiry programmatically, particularly now that Crunchbase &ndash; which has been my go-to resource for funding data &ndash; now charges for API calls. So I&rsquo;m going to go through old blog posts on Hack Education, and see if I can come up with a list of companies who haven&rsquo;t raised any money in the last couple of years. Edmodo, for example, hasn&rsquo;t seen any investment since 2014; Codecademy hasn&rsquo;t seen any since 2012.</p>
