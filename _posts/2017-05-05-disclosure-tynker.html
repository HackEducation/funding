<p>"Apple Partners With Tynker to Help K-5 Students Learn to Code," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-03-apple-partners-with-tynker-to-help-k-5-students-learn-to-code">Edsurge wrote on May 3, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Tynker <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Reach Capital, NewSchools Venture Fundi, and GSV Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products schools should buy.</p>
