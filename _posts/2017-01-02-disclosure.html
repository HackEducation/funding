<p>I created a new Twitter account today, <a href="http://twitter.com/disclosedtech">@disclosedtech</a>, that I'll be using to point out the shared funding connections between ed-tech products and ed-tech publications. I've noticed that Edsurge rarely adds disclosures to its articles (perhaps because it shares investors with almost every product it covers).</p> 

<p>I'm not sure sure how the Twitter account will work. Perhaps I'll RT an "offending" tweet and then link to an article here on this website with details about the funding.</p>
