<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for August 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $122,500,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 14</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $10.2 million / Median investment size: $4.2 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 6</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>August was a very slow month for investment &#8211; not a big surprise as it&#8217;s the summer holidays for the Northern hemisphere. There was also no giant deal this month in a Chinese startup, something that&#8217;s really driven the level of investment up and up this year. </p>

<p>The amount of money raised in August was the least it&#8217;s been all year. (The fewest number of deals, I should note, was in June.)</p>

<p>One of the notable investment trends this month: preschool management software. Three companies raised funding to help people run preschools in their homes: Wonderschool, WeeCare, and Procare Software. Investors include some of the &#8220;big money&#8221; names in Silicon Valley: Omidyar Network, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital Warburg Pincus.</p>

<p>There were also several companies claiming their worksheets are &#8220;adaptive&#8221; that raised money in August. One of them Knewton, which once boasted about its &#8220;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/13/437265231/meet-the-mind-reading-robo-tutor-in-the-sky">mind reading robo tutor in the sky</a>,&#8221; raised investment yet again, despite a long track record of vaporware. The company has raised some $182.3 million total, confirming that I do not understand any of the logic behind venture capital.</p>

<p>I would also be remiss if I did not note the passing of ChannelOne into the ed-tech dead pool. Good riddance.</p>

<h3>The Biggest Investments of 2018 (So Far)</h3>
<br />
<p>The companies that have raised the most money in 2018 (not including the venture capital firms that have raised new funds):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VIPKID</strong> (tutoring): $500 million</li>
<li><strong>Zuoyebang</strong> (tutoring): $350 million</li>
<li><strong>17zuoye</strong> (tutoring): $200 million</li>
<li><strong>DreamBox Learning</strong> (adaptive learning): $130 million</li>
<li><strong>Zhangmen</strong> (tutoring): $120 million</li>
<li><strong>Connexeo</strong> (school administration software): $110 million</li>
<li><strong>DadaABC</strong> (English language learning): $100 million</li>
<li><strong>Knowbox</strong> (tutoring): $100 million</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I can tell, these are now the most well-funded ed-tech startups (that is, those education companies which have not gone public):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SoFi</strong> (student loans): $2.156 billion</li>
<li><strong>VIPKID</strong> (tutoring): $825 million</li>
<li><strong>CommonBond</strong> (student loands): $803.6 million</li>
<li><strong>DadaABC.com</strong> (English language learning): $608.9 million</li>
<li><strong>Zuoyebang</strong> (tutoring): $585 million</li>
<li><strong>17zuoye</strong> (tutoring): $585 million</li>
<li><strong>EverFi</strong> (&#8220;critical skills&#8221; training): $251 million</li>
<li><strong>Yuanfudao</strong> (tutoring) â€“- $244.2 million</li>
<li><strong>BYJUs</strong> (tutoring): $244 million</li>
<li><strong>Coursera</strong> (online education): $210.1 million</li>
<li><strong>Knewton</strong> (adaptive learning): $182.3 million</li>
<li><strong>Age of Learning</strong> (educational apps): $181.5 million</li>
<li><strong>DreamBox Learning</strong> (adaptive learning): $175.6 million</li>
<li><strong>Udemy</strong> (skills training): $173 million</li>
<li><strong>AltSchool</strong> (private school; learning management system): $172.9 million</li>
<li><strong>D2L</strong> (learning management system): $165 million</li>
<li><strong>Udacity</strong> (skills training): $160 million</li>
</ul>

<p>I find this list, which I&#8217;d argue reflects what venture capitalists see as the &#8220;future of education,&#8221; incredibly depressing.</p>

<h3>Errata</h3>
<br />
<p>One of the problems of having &#8220;ed-tech funding update&#8221; on my To Do list for the last day of each month, is that I sometimes run the numbers before all the news is in. Such was the case for July. After I hit &#8220;publish&#8221; on <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2018/07/31/july">July&#8217;s article</a>, the press release was issued announcing that DreamBox Learning had raised $130 million. So I&#8217;ve adjusted the numbers for July accordingly across my spreadsheets (and any data you download will reflect this change too). But I thought it might be worthwhile to post a quick update here on each month&#8217;s funding totals:</p>

<ul>
<li>January: $336.8 million</li>
<li>February: $180.8 million</li>
<li>March: $404 million</li>
<li>April: $331.3 million</li>
<li>May: $246.2 million</li>
<li>June: $584.5 million</li>
<li>July: $757.5 million</li>
</ul>

<p>With August&#8217;s totals, that brings to $2.93 billion that has been invested in education companies so far this year &#8211; ahead of the total for the whole year in 2016.</p>
