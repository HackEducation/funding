<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for January 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $336.8 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $16.8 million / Median investment size: $4.1 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 14</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 0</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>It&#8217;s way way way too early in the year to talk about what the investment trends look like, what the biggest investments have been, and so on. But for what it&#8217;s worth, the year is off to a strong start, with more dollars invested in January 2018 than in January of the past two years. The number of acquisitions are also up from the previous few years. As we&#8217;ve seen in the past, the amount of investment is skewed by a couple of large ($100+ million) investments &#8211; and as we&#8217;ve seen in the past, these investments are in Chinese education companies.</p>
