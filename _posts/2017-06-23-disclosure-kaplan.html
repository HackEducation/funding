<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-16-learning-science-researcher-bror-saxberg-joins-chan-zuckerberg-initiative">Edsurge reports</a> that the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative has hired Bror Saxberg to lead its "learning engineering" efforts. Saxberg was formerly the Chief Learning Officer at Kaplan. Edsurge fails to disclose that <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">one of its investors</a>, Graham Holdings, <a href="http://network.hackeducation.com/2017/04/27/kaplan">owns Kaplan</a>.</p> 

<p>I have been tracking these failures to disclose financial relationships because Edsurge has been selling its Concierge service to K-12 schools in order to help them buy ed-tech products. The lack of transparency is important, I think. Now Edsurge says <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/concierge">it's ending the service</a>, but I'm still going to keep track of the publication's disclosure problems. It is particularly important to watch who is funding the narratives that Edsurge promotes in its stories about the future of education.</p>
