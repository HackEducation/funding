<p>Here is the latest data on &#8220;the business of education&#8221; for XXX:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of venture capital invested during the month: $246.2 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of investments: 15</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average investment size: $18.9 million / Median investment size: $15 million</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of acquisitions: 11</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of mergers: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of IPOs: 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number added to the &#8220;ed-tech dead pool&#8221;: 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment Trends</h3>
<br />
<p>Notable among this month&#8217;s investments were two learn-to-code companies raising money: Trilogy Education ($50 million) and Coding ($15 million). Another big round: OpenClassrooms, a French online provider that still invokes &#8220;MOOC&#8221; to describe itself (or at least journalists writing about it do) raised $60 million. But this was, overall, a very quiet month when it came to funding news. New Markets Venture Partners did announced it had finally closed a new $68 million fund. Its investors include a handful of student loan companies and testing companies &#8211; so that&#8217;s fun to think about what the portfolio is going to look like in turn. Priorities, yo. </p>

<p>Those four investments &#8211; New Markets, OpenClassrooms, Trilogy Education, and Coding &#8211; comprised almost 80% of the money invested in ed-tech this month.</p>

<p>Acquisition and &#8220;deadpool&#8221; news was a bit more exciting, I suppose, with WeWork continuing to gobble up education companies. This time it was MissionU&#8217;s turn, a one-year college alternative that barely made it one year as a company. </p>
