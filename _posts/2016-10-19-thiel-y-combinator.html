<p>When news broke this weekend about billionaire Peter Thiel&#8217;s donation to the Donald Trump presidential campaign, David Heinemeier Hansson (@dhh) &#8211; the creator of Ruby on Rails &#8211; Marco Arment &#8211; the co-founder of Tumblr &#8211; and <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/horrified-by-trump-silicon-valley-leaders-debate-cutting-ties-to-peter-thiel">others</a> challenged the startup accelerator Y Combinator about the organization&#8217;s ongoing relationship with Peter Thiel. (<a href="https://marco.org/2016/10/17/shame-on-y-combinator">Here is Arment&#8217;s blog post</a>.) Paul Graham, the organization&#8217;s founder responded by calling @dhh a troll (then deleting that tweet) then <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/788419807729164289">insisted</a> that &#8220;Few have done more than Sam Altman to defeat Trump.&#8221; Y Combinator&#8217;s current head Sam Altman <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/the-2016-election">responded</a>, refusing to sever ties with Thiel and framing that decision as something undertaken in the service of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>

<p>Considering how the tech industry frames the absence of women and people of color as a &#8220;pipeline&#8221; issue, considering how it&#8217;s been unable (and unwilling) to address &#8220;diversity&#8221; in its ranks, Y Combinator&#8217;s response here is insulting.</p>

<p>Project Include, an organization that advocates for women and people of color in technology, has <a href="https://medium.com/projectinclude/peter-thiel-yc-and-hard-decisions-2b91bab83764#.is3vfkvos">announced</a> it would break off its relationship with Y Combinator. Backstage Capital&#8217;s Arlan Hamilton, a fund that focuses female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs, tweeted that she would no longer recommend startups apply to Y Combinator.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/10/16/thiel-trump-education-technology">a long piece about Peter Thiel and the future of education technology</a>. In it, I listed the education companies that have received funding from Thiel and his venture capital firm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knewton</li>
<li>Declara</li>
<li>AltSchool</li>
<li>Thinkful</li>
<li>Clever</li>
<li>Uversity</li>
<li>ResearchGate</li>
<li>Lore</li>
<li>If You Can</li>
<li>SoFi</li>
<li>Upstart</li>
<li>Affirm</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some more data. A list of the education companies that Y Combinator (and founder Paul Graham) have invested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Codecademy</li>
<li>Clever</li>
<li>ClassDojo</li>
<li>Launchpad Toys</li>
<li>Tutorspree</li>
<li>Verbling</li>
<li>Knowmia</li>
<li>CodeCombat</li>
<li>Experiment</li>
<li>IXI-Play</li>
<li>One Month</li>
<li>Panorama Education</li>
<li>CodeNow</li>
<li>Cribspot</li>
<li>Platzi</li>
<li>WayUp</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2015, Y Combinator acquired ImagineK12, a startup accelerator program that was aimed at education companies. Here are the companies that have raised funding from ImagineK12:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edsurge</li>
<li>Remind</li>
<li>ClassDojo</li>
<li>NoRedInk</li>
<li>Bloomboard</li>
<li>Education Elements</li>
<li>Educreations</li>
<li>Eduvant</li>
<li>Goalbook</li>
<li>Nunook Interactive</li>
<li>Blendspace</li>
<li>CodeHS</li>
<li>DigitWhiz</li>
<li>Raise.me</li>
<li>Studyroom</li>
<li>Teachboost</li>
<li>Hapara</li>
<li>Kaizena</li>
<li>Learnsprout</li>
<li>Securly</li>
<li>Showbie</li>
<li>Socrative</li>
<li>AdmitSee</li>
<li>Front Row</li>
<li>Panorama Education</li>
<li>SchoolMint</li>
<li>Classkick</li>
<li>Educents</li>
<li>Showbie</li>
</ul>

<p>I would recommend educators ask these companies their thoughts on their investors&#8217; relationship to Thiel. Will they continue to work with Y Combinator or ImagineK12? Will they work with Thiel? Will they continue to take money from these organizations? Can they reconcile working in education with these investors and organizations&#8217; political beliefs about educators, unions, people of color, women? <em>Why should we trust these education companies if their funding comes from Thiel and his associates? Why should we trust them if they are silent now?</em></p>
