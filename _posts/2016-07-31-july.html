<p>When I wrote about funding for the year-to-date for ed-tech companies at the end of June, I noted that there had been <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/07/01/june">a significant downturn</a> in the amount of investment dollars flowing into the sector as well as the number of deals being made. A couple of factors were a play: 2015 was a record-setting year for ed-tech funding, so it would&#8217;ve been tough to keep up let alone surpass those figures. And furthermore, venture capitalists seem to have been tightening their belts in the early months of 2016 &#8211; not just in ed-tech but across the entire tech industry.</p>

<p>But just last week, investment analyst firm CB Insights published a blog post with the headline &#8220;<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-ed-tech-deals-funding-q2-2016/">Global Ed Tech Startup Deals And Funding See An Uptick</a>.&#8221; I usually report funding on a month-by-month basis, but I grouped the data by quarters so that I could compare my numbers to CB Insights&#8217;. The numbers are different; the patterns, similar:</p>

<p>Here's a different look at the same data:</p>

<p>For the month of July, the <em>number</em> of investments and the <em>amount</em> of investment both fell from the previous month:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount invested: $178,226,000</li>
<li>Number of investments: 12</li>
<li>Average investment size: $14,852,000 / Median: $10,000,000</li>
<li>Number of acquisitions: 12</li>
</ul>

<p>Dollars were off about $5.4 million from June. There were half as many deals.</p>

<p>I suppose we can debate whether ed-tech has seen an &#8220;uptick&#8221; or whether the &#8220;dip&#8221; will continue. I&#8217;m not sure that matters all that much as funding levels have always fluctuated month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. But I think we are seeing an increase in the size of investments (something that skews both the totals and the averages) &#8211; and this likely marks a maturation of sorts for the sector. Lots of companies will not be able to raise Series B, C, etc rounds, and in the current funding climate, they&#8217;re likely to <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/03/26/sustainability">struggle</a> (close their doors, be acquired). (When I hear many ed-tech startups boasting that they have 50 employees, I smell an unsustainable burn rate.)</p>
