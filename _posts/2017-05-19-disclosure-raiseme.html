<p>"U of Chicago, UPenn, Harvey Mudd Among Colleges to Join Scholarship App Raise.me," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-18-creativelive-raises-25m-to-expand-artistic-entrepreneurship-education-platform">Edsurge wrote on May 16, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Raise.Me<a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: GSV and ImagineK12.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
