<p>It&#8217;s time once again to calculate the &#8220;deal flow&#8221; in ed-tech startup land. And <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/02/02/january">as I noted last month</a>, 2016 seems to be off to a far less auspicious start than 2015. Last year, there were 26 funding rounds in February, totaling almost $430 million. By my calculations, there were just 14 this past month, and the amount raised was about one third of the amount this time last year &#8211; $149.7 million. (To be fair, February 2015 had two huge investments: SoFi raising $200 million and 17zuoye raising $100 million. The largest this past month was Student.com&#8217;s $60 million round.) February&#8217;s investment numbers and amount was also down from January 2016.</p>

<p>There were 10 acquisitions and 2 mergers in February. (During the same month last year, there were 8 acquisitions and no mergers.)</p>

<p>Some of the most popular areas for investment so far this year: private student loans, online assessment, online courses, and online tutoring.</p>

<p>The companies that have raised the most money so far this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student.com ($60 million)</li>
<li>Grovo and Jerry Education ($40 million each)</li>
<li>Degreed ($21 million)</li>
<li>College Ave ($20 million)</li>
<li>After School ($16.4 million)</li>
<li>Digischool ($15.7 million)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the data &#8211; JSON files that include all of January and February investment, acquisition, and merger information &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/hackeducation/funding">in the GitHub repo</a> that powers this website. </p>
