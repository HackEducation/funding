<p><em>These are the investments and acquisitions related to part eight of my year-in-review series &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/robots-and-work.html">Robots Are Coming For Your Jobs</a>.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>One of the notable shifts in the stories that investors seemed to be telling in 2017: it&#8217;s not enough to invest in training startups; you have to invest in hiring startups too. (Really, you can see how they&#8217;re committed to monetizing every element of the economy &#8211; from education to employment.)</p>

<p>But I confess: I didn&#8217;t pick up on this trend &#8217;til mid-way through the year, so I&#8217;m not sure if I have all the companies that raised money for this in my calculations. Here&#8217;s what I got:</p>

<h3>Job Recruitment and Job Placement Investments in 2017</h3>
