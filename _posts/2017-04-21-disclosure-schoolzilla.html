<p>"Schoolzilla 'File Configuration Error' Exposes Data for More Than 1.3M Students, Staff," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-20-schoolzilla-file-configuration-error-exposes-data-for-more-than-1-3m-students-staff">Edsurge wrote on April 20, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Schoolzilla <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge">share an investor</a>: Reach Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service in which it recommends ed-tech products to them.</p>

<p><em>For more information about this and other disclosure alerts, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2017/01/02/disclosure">read this blog post.</a></em></p>
