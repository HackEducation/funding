<p>"Pearson, an Investor in Knewton, Is 'Phasing Out' Partnership on Adaptive Products," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-12-pearson-an-investor-in-knewton-is-phasing-out-partnership-on-adaptive-products">Edsurge wrote on May 12, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and Knewton<a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: GSV. Pearson is also one of the largest limited partners in Learn Capital, another Edsurge investor.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
