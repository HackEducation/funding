<p>"AltSchool CEO Max Ventilla Closes First $40 Million in New Funding Round," <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-05-03-altschool-ceo-max-ventilla-closes-first-40m-in-new-funding-round">Edsurge wrote on May 3, 2017</a>. This article fails to disclose that Edsurge and AltSchool <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">share investors</a>: Learn Capital.</p>

<p>This sort of disclosure (or lack thereof) is particularly important as Edsurge now sells schools a service recommending which ed-tech products they should buy.</p>
