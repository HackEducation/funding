<p><em>This article helps provide funding data for <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/politics.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/inequality.html">part 10</a> of <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">my annual review of the year in ed-tech</a></em></p>

<p>I covered the expansion of (and rebuke to) Bridge International Academies in two of the articles in this series. That chain of private schools did not raise funding this year. (Investors in Bridge International Academies include the Gates Foundation, Zuckerberg Education Ventures, the Omidyar Network, Rethink Education, and the CDC Group.)</p>

<p>There were several others &#8211; and they share the same investors in many cases &#8211; that did.</p>

<ul>
<li>Andela ($24,000,000) &#8211; investors include Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, CRE Venture Capital, Learn Capital, Omidyar Network, Google Ventures, and Spark Capital</li>
<li>Spark Schools ($9,000,000) &#8211; investors include the Omidyar Network</li>
<li>UNICAF ($12,000,000) &#8211; investors include University Ventures, CDC Group, and Savannah Fund</li>
</ul>

<p>One prominent African investor this year was Naspers &#8211; a South African media conglomerate and &#8220;<a href="http://qz.com/161792/naspers-africas-most-fascinating-company/">the former mouthpiece of apartheid</a>.&#8221; It backed Brainly, Udemy, and Codecademy.</p>
