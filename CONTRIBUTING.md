# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because despite not having comments on my websites I do hope that people feel like they can help contribute to enhancing research about the ed-tech industry.

## Submitting changes or comments

Please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hackeducation/funding/issues/new) with a question or comment. You can also submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/hackeducation/funding/pulls) if there's a particular correction you believe needs to be made. Please make comments and changes as atomic as possible. It's just me working on this site, but I will try to respond promptly. 

Thanks,
Audrey
