<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edsurge#/entity">According to Crunchbase</a>, Edsurge has raised $5.66 million in venture capital since 2012. (The list of investors in Crunchbase do not match <a href="http://about.edsurge.com/advisors_supporters/">the list of investors on Edsurge's website</a>.) Edsurge's backers are some of the most active investors in ed-tech startups more generally, raising a lot of questions about the "independence" the company claims in its coverage of the industry.</p>

<p>Edsurge has also received a number of grants. Its Gates Foundation grants, for example, <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">total $5.2 million</a>. (The Gates Foundation has also funded several of Edsurge's investors, including NewSchools Venture Fund and  Reach Capital.) In addition to the Gates Foundation, Edsurge has received grant funding from the Joyce Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. (It is not clear if CZI has <em>invested</em> or just given grant funding to various story projects as Zuckerberg's venture philanthropy company fails to be very transparent with its funding record.)</p>

<p>Edsurge also takes sponsorship dollars from the industry in order to research and write articles (<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2018/01/31/edsurge-sponsors">here is a list of companies who sponsored content in 2017</a>), as well as to appear at its conferences. This project is a work in progress, and I have not yet pulled all the data from the Edsurge website to assess who has sponsored content or conference booths.</p>
